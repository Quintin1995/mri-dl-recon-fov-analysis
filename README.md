# MRI DLRecon FOV Analysis
Under active development.

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for analyzing a **Deep Learning Reconstruction (DLR)** model on accelerated k-space MRI data. The study focuses on evaluating the visual quality metrics across different **Fields of View (FOVs)** and assesses the model's performance in various anatomical regions. This analysis aims to enhance MRI efficiency and image quality, particularly for prostate cancer diagnostics.

## Methods
### Dataset
The training dataset comprises 312 patients from the publicly available fastMRI prostate k-space dataset from New York University (NYU). The testing cohort includes 120 patients from the UMCG dataset, collected between 2022 and 2024, suspected of having clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).

### Model Training
The DLR model was trained using various undersampling schemes with acceleration factors of 2, 4, 6, and 8. Different fractions of the fully sampled central k-space region were retained, and retrospective undersampling patterns were applied.

### Evaluation Metrics
Visual quality metrics such as **SSIM**, **PSNR**, and **HFEN** were computed for different acceleration factors (R3 and R6). These metrics were analyzed on each 2D slice and lesion-specific 2D slices to assess the modelâ€™s performance comprehensively.

## Results
### Violin Plot
- The violin plots below illustrate the distribution of SSIM, PSNR, and HFEN for the 120 patients across acceleration factors R3 and R6.

### Fields of View (FOVs)
1. **Full Abdominal View (FAV)**: This full view includes the air around the body and is obtained directly from k-space without any cropping.
2. **Clinical Prostate View (CPV)**: This view focuses on the prostate and surrounding organs, excluding air around the body. It is typically a 2x zoomed version of the abdominal FOV.
3. **Targeted Lesion Region (TLR)**: A PIRADS 3+ lesion segmentation drawn by radiologists, with an additional 10 pixels added to both the x and y dimensions.

### Key Findings
- Significant reduction in reconstruction time for accelerated datasets.
- SSIM values differed significantly between global (CPV) and local (PR) regions, indicating the importance of targeted quality assessments.
- Interaction terms showed more pronounced SSIM degradation in diagnostically relevant regions, such as the TLR and PR, at higher acceleration factors (p < 0.001).

## Visual Quality Metrics
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)**: Assesses the similarity between two images.
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Measures the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise.
- **HFEN (High-Frequency Error Norm)**: Evaluates the preservation of high-frequency details in the image.

## Acceleration Factors
- **R1**: Ground truth (3 averages with a parallel imaging factor of 2) created using Root Sum of Squares (RSS).
- **R3**: First out of three averages.
- **R6**: Half an average with a parallel imaging factor of 4.

## Example Segmentations with TotalSegmentator
In addition to the FAV, CPV, and TLR, four reference regions were assessed using IQMs. Total body segmentation was performed using the TotalSegmentator (https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator). The reference regions considered are:
- **SFR**: Subcutaneous fat region.
- **MR**: Muscle region.
- **PR**: Prostate region.
- **FR**: Femur left region.
